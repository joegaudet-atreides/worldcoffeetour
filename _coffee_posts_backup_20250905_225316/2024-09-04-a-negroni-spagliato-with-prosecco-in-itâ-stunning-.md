notes: "A Negroni, Spagliato, with Prosecco in itâ¦. Stunning.

Today was a big day, filled with beauty, awe, and a bit of harrowing driving.

We visited the Castle San Elmo at the top of the hill in Naples, a 365 degree view of the city and the Med.

Then on to Pompeii, itâs a rare thing to have something so wildly exceed your already very high expectations. Iâm not sure it was possible for me to think about the Roman Empire moreâ¦ but here we are.

Then a quick, amazing bite, at a family restaurant in the  country. Eggplant parm might be the best thing Iâve ever tasted.

A wild drive on the windiest road Iâve ever seen all to be greeted by the amalfi coast, and another profoundly beautiful view.

Suffice it to say, Iâve been failing to hold back tears for most of the day. This place truly is awe-some, and I feel a deep sense of privilege and gratitude to have got to see and experience it, if only for a short few days.
