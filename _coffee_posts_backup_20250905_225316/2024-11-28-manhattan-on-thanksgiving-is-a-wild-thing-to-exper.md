A meditation on gratitude:

If you follow me, I assume weâre either friends or family-or youâre someone strangely interested the caffeine addicted ramblings of a middle aged Canadian. So, you no doubt know Iâve been going through it these past few months. Most peopleâs midlife crisis involves one sudden change, mine seems to be shaping up to be a full reset.

As I wandered the empty streets of the lower east side, through the Bowery, listening to music and taking in the cinematic sights, my heart, apropos of the day, has been filled with gratitude.

For my old friends, who have showed up in the most profound ways. For the new friends Iâve made on this trip, that have let me into their lives, shown me their city. For the Brooklyn hipsters I met last night that have invited me to dinner tonight. And for this rare opportunity to be the author of my next chapter.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you all.

Happy thanksgiving!"
