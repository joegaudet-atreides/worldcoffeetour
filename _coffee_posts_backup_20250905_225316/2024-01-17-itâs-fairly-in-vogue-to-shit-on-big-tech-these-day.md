In addition to helping me read signs, menus, and the bidet instructions. It enabled me to have a wonderful (albeit stilted) conversation with Yoko for my train ride from Tokyo to Osaka. 

I was just settling in for the ride out of Tokyo when she tapped me frantically and demanded I take her seat and look out the window, where Mount Fuji was waiting. We proceeded to have a 2 hour long conversation covering everything from her grandkids to my marital status (which she was very concerned about) - all through text. 

Itâs probably cliche to say, but thereâs something really magical about traveling. I always expect things to be so wildly different, which they certainly are in some respects, but also Iâm always shocked at how the same so much is. And Iâm always amazed by the kindness of strangers.

Thank you Yoko."
