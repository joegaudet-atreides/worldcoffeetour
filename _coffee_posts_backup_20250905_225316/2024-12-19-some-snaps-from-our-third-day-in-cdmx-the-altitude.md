notes: Some snaps from our third day in CDMX, the altitude sickness worn off we adventured out to a big church that legit looked like a set out of Star Wars, and then spent the evening bar hopping with our new danish friend Jonas (a gem of a human) and capped it off with some live Cuban music and fine cigar. A massive shout out to my travel pal @tinaaluu, experiencing new places is so deeply good for the soul but doing it while uncontrollably laughing so hard your belly hurts is infinitely better. Also the mescal here is very fine.
