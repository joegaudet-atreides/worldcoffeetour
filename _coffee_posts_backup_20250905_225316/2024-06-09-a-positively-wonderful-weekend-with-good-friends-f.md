But most of all the biggest thanks to @turnerbri who rapped up the weekend treating me to a private spa experience in Granville island. Being a man of a certain age this is the sort of thing i have never really let my self enjoy, but it was hands down one of the most relaxing and enjoyable 90 minutes, could not recommend more. And the ensuing seafood feast was a perfect cap to my 41st year."
