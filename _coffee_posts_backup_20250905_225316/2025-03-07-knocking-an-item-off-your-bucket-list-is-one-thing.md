Iâve wanted to ski here since I watched a street segment from Attack of La NiÃ±a in 2011. The vibes were everything I love about the skiing I did growing up, stoked people getting after it, with no pretence.

Skiing big pow turns at 12.5 k feet was, hard, Iâm currently knackered AF, but so very happy.

(The stickers are amazing)

Hilarious side note, I met not one, but two folks that had met or ridden with people I know from childhood or college. Cliche I know, but the world is big and small all at once.

This marks the end of our trip, so much love for my long time adventure pal @sarahkaysmith, and a big up to @nerdlafkie for showing us the Colorado ropes."
