title: "PlutÃ´t la Vie: Choose Life Instead

Choose life instead of those prisms with no depth even if their colors are purer
Instead of this hour always hidden instead of these terrible vehicles of cold flam"

notes: "PlutÃ´t la Vie: Choose Life Instead

Choose life instead of those prisms with no depth even if their colors are purer
Instead of this hour always hidden instead of these terrible vehicles of cold flame
Instead of these overripe stones
Choose this heart with its safety catch
Instead of that murmuring pool
And that white fabric singing in the air and the earth at the same time
Instead of that marriage blessing joining my forehead to total vanityâs
Choose life

Choose life with its conspiratorial sheets
Its scars from escapes
Choose life choose that rose window on my tomb
The life of being here nothing but being here
Where one voice says Are you there where another answers Are you there
Iâm hardly here at all alas
And even when we might be making fun of what we kill
Choose life

Choose life choose life venerable Childhood
The ribbon coming out of a fakir
Resembles the playground slide of the world
Though the sun is only a shipwreck
Insofar as a womanâs body resembles it
You dream contemplating the whole length of its trajectory
Or only while closing your eyes on the adorable storm named your hand
Choose life

Choose life with its waiting rooms
When you know youâll never be shown in
Choose life instead of those health spas
Where youâre served by drudges
Choose life unfavorable and long
When the books close again here on less gentle shelves
And when over there the weather would be better than better it would be free yes
Choose life

Choose life as the pit of scorn
With that head beautiful enough
Like the antidote to that perfection it summons and it fears
Life the makeup on Godâs face
Life like a virgin passport
A little town like Pont-Ã¡-Mousson
And since everythingâs already been said
Choose life instead

Years ago Paul wrote a short story titled PlutÃ´t la Vie, I canât for the life of me remember the plot of it, but this phrase âRather Lifeâ (the direct translation) has always stuck with me. After a bit of googling I found the above  poem by AndrÃ© Breton, gorgeous.

Second, a bit of BK vintage flash originally drawn by local legend @oldcalcutta and lovingly applied by @montybanjo"
