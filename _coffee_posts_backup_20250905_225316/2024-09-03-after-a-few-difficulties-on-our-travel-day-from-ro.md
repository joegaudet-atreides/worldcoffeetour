notes: "After a few difficulties on our travel day from Rome, we finally made it to Naples and it did not disappoint, the city has so much character and beauty-every alley we walked down was a picture frame. One of the oldest inhabited regions in the world, it has all of the bedlam of an East Asian cyberpunk city, but with Roman features and Mt. Vesuvius in the distanceâ¦ also can confirm the pizza was dope.

Vedi Napoli e poi Muori."
