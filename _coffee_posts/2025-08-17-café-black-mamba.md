notes: "Day two stop on the #worldcoffeetour the excellently name . I forgot the absolute delight of orange espresso tonics that seem to be prevalent in Latin America, and this hot banana bread is perhaps the best banana bread I-'ve had not made by a mother. Humorous aside: I-'ve managed to get good enough at the first few exchanges that it gives the impression I know Spanish, which is very much not the case."
