4. **Skip optional fields** initially, add details later

## ‚ùå Why Automated Scraping Fails

Instagram has implemented **aggressive anti-bot measures**:

- **Rate limiting** - blocks repeated requests
- **JavaScript challenges** - detects headless browsers  
- **Device fingerprinting** - identifies automated tools
- **IP blocking** - temporary bans after detection
- **CAPTCHA challenges** - human verification required

Even **Selenium with stealth mode** gets detected within minutes.

## üöÄ Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Week 1:** Use manual method for 10-20 recent posts  
**Week 2:** Get Instagram data export for complete history  
**Result:** Complete coffee tour website with hundreds of posts!

## üìä Expected Results by Method

| Method | Success Rate | Posts Retrieved | Time Required |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Data Export | 100% | ALL posts | 2-3 days wait |
| Browser Extension | 90% | Most posts | 1-2 hours |
| Manual Entry | 100% | As many as you want | 2-3 min/post |
| Automated Scraping | <5% | 0-10 posts | Immediate failure |

## üéØ Recommended Strategy

1. **Start immediately** with manual entry for your top 10-20 coffee posts
2. **Request data export** today (48hr wait)
3. **Process export data** when it arrives
4. **Combine both** for the complete experience

Your dark-themed coffee tour site is ready at **http://localhost:4000** - just add your posts!

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Use descriptive titles** from your captions
- **Add precise coordinates** for map accuracy  
- **Group by regions** automatically works
- **High-quality images** make the cycling background stunning
- **Full captions become notes** - preserved perfectly

The Instagram Data Export method will give you **everything** - potentially hundreds of posts with full metadata!
