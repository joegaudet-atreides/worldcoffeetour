notes: "After 34 years of skiing at Fernie you might think there was nothing new left to experience... and yet, today they opened the (apologies for the name) gobblers knob zone for the first time Iâve been around, and I enjoyed a fantastic rip with my sis and crew, the day continued with some classic lines (of variable condition) great to be home kootenany"
