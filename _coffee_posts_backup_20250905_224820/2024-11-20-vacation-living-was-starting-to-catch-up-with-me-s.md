notes: "Vacation living was starting to catch up with me, so I decided to find a boxing gym (I took it up two months ago) to sweat out last nightâs cocktails. @churchstreetboxinggym is just down the street, and is fucking legit, super friendly folks, and my classmates were cheering me on as I struggled to finish.

Is it still a thirst trap if itâs just a picture of me where in Iâm sweaty and desirous of water? Asking for a friend.

(Please ignore my horrible form, those arms should be in tight)"
