notes: "âItâs like... Itâs like we were pals then. You know, weâd do things together. Weâd look at the knight armor at the Met, the scary fish at the natural history museum. I was always afraid of the squid and the whale fighting. I could only look at it with my hands in front of my face. When weâd get home, after my bath, sheâd go through all the different things we saw that day at the museum and... And weâd get to the Squid and the Whale and sheâd describe it for me which was, maybe, still scary but it was less scary. Anyway, it was fun, it was fun to hear about it.â

The squid and the whale has a special spot in my heart , and my friendship with @jaybaydala. A beautiful and hilarious story about love, divorce, becoming a man, if youâve not seen it, I couldnât recommend it more.

With him joining me for a bit in NYC, it felt only right to spend a day exploring the museum and Central Park. (We stopped by the oldest bar in the US for good measure) 

Love you brother #philistine"
