Huge shout out to @jon_cartwright and Michelle for put on the second of what I hope continues to be an annual event.

Since many people asked, I told the story of me getting rescued from the whistler back country, a mix of learnings, a bit of wonder (you havenât seen beautiful until youâve seen the moon rise in the middle of the night over a cold mountain range) and some good laughs. If I havenât you told it before, next time we get beers!"
