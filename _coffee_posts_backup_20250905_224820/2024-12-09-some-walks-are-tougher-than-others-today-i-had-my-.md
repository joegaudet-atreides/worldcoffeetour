notes: "Some walks are tougher than others.

Today I had my last one with Chet.

After a fair bit of reflection, it became clear that it was for the best for all three of us that he find his permanent home with his mom.

Iâm grateful for her for so many things, not least among them the happy home heâs going to enjoy for the rest of his days.

Iâll miss our lunatic wrassles, couch naps, and long walks through this beautiful city I call home.

To quote John Stewart: âin a world of good boys, heâs the bestâ"
