So Here It Is\n---\n\nIf youâre a regular of the feed, you may have noticed a conspicuous absence of culinary posts. Iâve been having a hard time getting it together to cook of late, but while chatting with my wee sis today I was reminded that my favourite dish of all time is shepherds pie (though specifically made by my mom). So here it is, next best thing, and perfect for a cold November Sunday.

Did I have to make  JoÃ«l Robuchon Potatoes for the top, no, are they amazing, yes.

(A thing only learned a few years ago, this is infact a cottage pie, since you know shepherds donât shepherd cowsâ¦)
