What a show, no fucking words.

Ok some words, that show was positively amazing. The serendipity of LCD soundsystem
being here while I am, a band Iâve longed to see for ages, playing on their home turf-undeniable amazing. When they played dance you self clean, and everyone sang ah ahhhhhhhhh holding their hands up into the light of the massive disco ball, it was as close to a religious experience as I think Iâve ever had. 

Easily in the top 5 shows Iâve ever seen.
