Some folks have asked about the design. Years ago I came across the Japanese concept of âMono no awareâ - the pathos of things. The gentle sadness you feel at the impermanence of life. Often represented by the Sakura âcherry blossomâ which is never more beautiful than right before it starts dying. 

I wanted a bigger piece for my sleeve and thought it a nice theme - also I love the cherry blossoms here in Vancouver every year and am always sad to see them go.

Sunmi did such a wonderful job translating the idea into something beautiful-and cheering me on for the last hour that really fucking sucked.
