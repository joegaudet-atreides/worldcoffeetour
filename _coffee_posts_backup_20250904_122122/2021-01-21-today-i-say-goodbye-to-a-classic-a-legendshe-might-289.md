She might not have been the most reliable steed (she wasnât at all), and she was always a costly date. But most of the time she got me somewhere worth going, and was a riot along the way. Iâll miss being on the highway behind a slow car, dropping it into third and flying away at 160 getting sucked into the seats. And Iâll miss the looks she got from car lovers as I rolled into the Whistler parking lot with low profile winter tires on. 

Sheâs gone to a pal of mine that has the skills needed to keep her alive for another 350km of adventure.

An end of an era.
