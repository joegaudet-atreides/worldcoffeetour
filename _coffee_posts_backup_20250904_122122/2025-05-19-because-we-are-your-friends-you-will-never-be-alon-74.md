Excuse me while I pick my jaw up off the floor.

What a perfect weekend of dancing & laughing. 

So grateful to be able to come here and share it with my old friend and brother, two of my oldest friends, and a newly minted one. Itâs such a privilege to know gents as fine as you to howl at moon with!
