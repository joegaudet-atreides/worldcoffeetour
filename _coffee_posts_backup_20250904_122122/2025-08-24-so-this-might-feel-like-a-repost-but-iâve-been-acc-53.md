The first time I remember really noticing the Milky Way as a structure was while filling the back of a pickup truck with dirt for our driveway in Jaffray with my stepdad John. We were down some dark dirt road on the edge of Lake Koocanusa, far from any city lights. I remember looking up and being shocked that you could see the dust of the galactic centerâawesome is really the only word for it.

Memory is so interesting. While I was looking up at the stars yesterdayâconsiderably brighter to the naked eye here, both due to altitude and the lack of moistureâI was also back on that dirt road in my late teens, about to embark on adulthood.

Thereâs a profound smallness, but also connectedness, looking up at the night sky. But the glow of the city, for all its benefits, robs us of that perspective. 

A favorite quote from Carl Sagan: âWe are a way for the universe to know itself.â

It was such a pleasure to experience this with one of my best friends, @tinaaluu, on our second amazing trip to Latin America.

Some things we saw:

The Southern Cross, something Iâve never seen before as itâs not visible in the Northern Hemisphere

The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two galaxies we can see with the naked eye

Alpha Centauri

Arcturus, a star 500 times bigger, but also 500 times farther away than Alpha Centauri, the same size in the sky but a gorgeous red colour.

Saturn and its rings, plus its largest moon Titanâthe only moon with an atmosphere in the solar system

The photos were all taken with long exposure. Iâve added two taken by professionals that donât even look realâbut it really did look like that.

If you ever find yourself in this part of the world, please do yourself a favor and see it.
