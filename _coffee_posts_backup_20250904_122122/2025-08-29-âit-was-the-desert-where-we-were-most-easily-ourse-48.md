San Pedro de Atacama 1/2

â

An ex of mine was a great admirer of the desert, as someone that has spent the balance of their life in a different cold desolate climate it never really landed for me. Not nearly enough weeeeee for younger Joe.

As is often the case, Iâm happy to have been wrong about that. The Atacama desert was arresting in its beauty, the colours, the animals, the difficulty breathing.

Iâve never seen flamingos in the wild, and as you may or may not have noticed ageing has turned me into a bit of a flower guyâ¦ seems birds are perhaps next on the list. Watching the flamboyance circle the lagoon with their massive wings was only surpasses by the silliness of their landing maneuvers (they run their weird long legs as fast as they can frantically trying to find purchase).

Come to the desert, but be sure and bring altitude sickness pills
