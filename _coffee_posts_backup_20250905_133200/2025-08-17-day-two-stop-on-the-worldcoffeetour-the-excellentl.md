notes: "Day two stop on the #worldcoffeetour the excellently name @cafeblackmamba. I forgot the absolute delight of orange espresso tonics that seem to be prevalent in Latin America, and this hot banana bread is perhaps the best banana bread Iâve had not made by a mother.

Humorous aside: Iâve managed to get good enough at the first few exchanges that it gives the impression I know Spanish, which is very much not the case."
