While the above sorta reads like Micheal Scott and Wayne Gretzky, it felt appropriate a quote for this Chilean sunset having finally finished it earlier this year, and in someways feeling a kinship with the characters/generation (minus that whole war and impotency part part of course)

In any case, great book, better sunshine. The wild vacation part of the trip is coming to a close so I promise the posts will return to coffee and the occasional weekend trip, too good not to share.
