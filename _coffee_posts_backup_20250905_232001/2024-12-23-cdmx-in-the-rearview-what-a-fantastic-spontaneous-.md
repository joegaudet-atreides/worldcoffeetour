What a fantastic, spontaneous, and delightful week. Iâm not much of a âuniverseâ guy as you all no doubt know, but reflecting on it I cannot help but feel lucky/grateful for my reconnecting and deepening friendship with @tinaaluu. And for our happenstance meeting of @j.bund, truly three kindred spirits - I may have added more than a few wrinkles to my face from laughing so hard this week.

Iâm back home to go play in the mountains next, but fret not, Iâm sure Iâll find more good coffee for you all to admire."
