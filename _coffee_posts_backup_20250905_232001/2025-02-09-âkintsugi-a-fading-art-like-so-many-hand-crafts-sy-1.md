notes: "âKintsugi, a fading art like so many hand
crafts symbolizes the truth that repair
requires transformation, that the
pristine is less beautiful than the
broken, and that the shape of us is
impossible to see until itâs fractured.
Until a wound like a crack runs its
lengthâ - Nerwriter, Kintsugi: The Art of Embracing Damage

I got a set of these cups when I was in Japan from @glitch_coffee_osaka, they have a special place in my heart as reminder of a trip Iâd wanted to go on my whole life, and all the associated beautiful memories from that time. So naturally I was a bit heart broken when I dropped one on the floor.

Enter Kintsugi, and the folks at @mendedwith.gold, they did such a great job repairing it, I couldnât be more happy!"
